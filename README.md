# Job Data Automation (IBM Coursework)

This project automates the extraction of job-related data from external APIs, streamlining the data collection process and significantly reducing manual effort. The aim is to optimize the time spent on data collection and enhance the efficiency of data storage and processing.

## Project Overview

This project automates the extraction and processing of job-related data from APIs. The automated workflow reduces data collection time by 50% by using **Python** and various libraries, allowing for more efficient handling and storage of data in **Excel**.

## Key Steps Involved

1. **Automated Data Extraction**:
   - Developed an automated system to extract job data from APIs using **Python**.
   - The data extraction process was optimized, reducing the time spent on manual data collection by 50%.

2. **Data Processing and Storage**:
   - Processed the extracted data using Python libraries such as **requests** and **pandas**.
   - Efficiently stored the processed data in **Excel** using **openpyxl** to ensure data is readily available for further analysis.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Integrated with job data APIs to fetch real-time data for job positions, salary details, and other relevant information.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for automation and data processing.
- **requests**: A Python library to send HTTP requests to external APIs and retrieve job data.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for processing and cleaning the extracted data.
- **openpyxl**: A Python library used to write the processed data into Excel files for storage and further use.
- **Excel**: Used as the storage medium for the extracted and processed job data.

## Results

The automated system successfully reduced the job data collection time by 50%, improving productivity and ensuring more accurate and timely data for further analysis.
